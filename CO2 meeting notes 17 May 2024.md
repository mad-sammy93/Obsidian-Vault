## Story point estimation    

1. ** Creation of Recurring Meetings:**
    
    - The system should allow users to create recurring meetings with customizable recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly).
    - Users should be able to specify the start date and time for the recurring meetings.
2. **Recurrence Patterns:**
    
    - Users should have the option to choose different recurrence patterns such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
    - For weekly recurrence, users should be able to select specific weekdays.
3. **End Date and Indefinite Recurrence:**
    
    - Users should be able to specify an end date for recurring meetings.
    - The system should provide an option for indefinite recurrence if no end date is specified.
4. **Validation and Conflicts:**
    
    - The system should validate the recurrence pattern and end date to prevent conflicts with existing bookings.
    - If a conflict arises with an existing booking during the recurrence period, users should be notified and prompted to resolve the conflict.
5. **Modification and Cancellation:**
    
    - Users should be able to modify or cancel individual instances of a recurring meeting without affecting the entire series.
    - Changes made to a recurring meeting instance should be reflected in the system and notifications should be sent to affected participants.
6. **Visibility and Management:**
    
    - Recurring meetings should be clearly distinguishable from one-time meetings in the user interface.
    - Users should have the ability to view and manage all instances of a recurring meeting series from a centralized location.
7. **Testing:**
    
    - The functionality should undergo thorough testing to ensure reliability and accuracy in generating recurring meetings according to the specified patterns.
    - Unit tests and integration tests should cover all aspects of the recurring meeting creation, modification, and cancellation processes.
8. **User Feedback:**
    
    - Solicit feedback from users during the testing phase to identify any usability issues or improvements needed in the recurring meeting functionality.
