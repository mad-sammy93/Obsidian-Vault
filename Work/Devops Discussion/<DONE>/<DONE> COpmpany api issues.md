Regarding the sortBy and sortType issue ,


Since the backend change for the sort and sort type  as two fields was change to "- [sortby] " format was also request to be changed by Tapan,
I wanted to know why Since We are also reffereing to Tapan's Straight8 project which also uses the EasyDatatable package and also has the sortBy and sortType fields separately.
