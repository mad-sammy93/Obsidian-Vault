### TODO###

- **Add placeholder for proper format of url during add/update company**

- **Limit number of clicks in UX (when contributor is added, then it could be made not mandatory to click to hide the toast message)**

- **Consistency in design (tags input for monitors and urls look different in add project screen)**
