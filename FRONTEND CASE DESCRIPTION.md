4. Validate all inputs on both the API and frontend to ensure data integrity.
    
5. Prioritize security considerations throughout the development process.
    
6. Follow industry standard coding.
    
7. Minimize external library usage to maintain control over dependencies.
    

  
  

Implement docker into the project

  
  

  
  

**Key** **Requirements****:**
